Engineering has been a passion from a very young age and my love for building things and solving problems has continued to grow over the years. I am enthusiastic about growing and learning new skills on my engineering journey whether it be through academics, side projects, or internships. I enjoy drinking coffee and tinkering with my multiple 3D printers. I would love to hear from you to discuss news in the tech space or anything else!</p>

                            <p>In order to consolidate our knowledge of embedded programming in C and development of embedded systems, I had to create a data-aquisition system that translated accelerometer data into a binary-coded-decimal output. The system was based on an Esduino Extreme microcontroller and performed the ADC conversion and interpolation of the transistor data. Furthermore, I added a real-time graphing component to the system that would take the data from the microcontroller and using matplotlib, plot the angle of the accelerometer.</p>

                                    <p>Though for school, my team and I are having a blast building a wireless air guitar using arduino and a custom web app. Our goal is to make guitars more portable by making a pick that intelligently
                                    senses strumming motion and communicates to a custom web app to play chords based on user selection.</p>

                                    <div class="subheading mb-2">September 2018 - Present</div>
                                    <p>I fell in love with 3D Printing as soon as I as I was exposed to it and now it's become a full-time hobby that I sometimes spend too much time on. Over the years, I have grown my collection of printers and now I own 
                                    two printers that I'm constantly working on. My most recent one, a Tronxy XS5A has given me a lot of grief and I have been developing solutions to remedy the issues. The most prevalent problem happens with leveling the 
                                    bed of the print surface (something that is crucial to a successful print). Since the bed is so large on this printer, it can skew slightly during the levelling process and during prints which makes it difficult to repeat prints 
                                    consistently. My solution to this problem was to create a custom level checker using and arduino, accelerometer, ultrasonic sensors and a 7 segment display to see how level the bed was so that I can make adjustments accordingly. I was able to apply my solidworks
                                    knowledge too in order to design and print a custom mount and a shield for the ultrasonic sensors.</p>

                                    <div class="subheading mb-2">June 2018 - September 2018</div>
                                    <p>To consolidate all the knowledge I had acquired over the summer learning web app programming, I built a simple joke bot using a couple APIs that would randomly generate a dad joke, pun or one-liner and display a gif that 
                                    was related to the joke. Since this project I have also done several follow along projects revolving around core programming concepts and machine learning, all of which are avaialable on my GitHub.</p>

                    <p>When I am not working, I am usually catching up on the latest news in tech. People like Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai are role models and I like to keep up with what their companies are up to. 
                    It's always enjoyable to see what next generation technologies are being released to the world. Aside from that, most of my downtime is spent on working on my two 3D Printers. 3D Printing can really be a labour of love,
                    especially when you buy more complex printers that require greater maintainance and care. I have learnt a lot, wasted a lot of filament, and am continously improving my printers and the quality of prints I can achieve. Additive 
                    manufacturing is incredibly facinating!</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Besides all the nerdy stuff, I am a really big Formula 1 fan! The strategy and speed of the sport are jawdropping and even though in recent years the specticle of the sport has been somewhat missing because of 
                    the Mercedes dominance, there are still some really amazing races that leave me on the edge of my seat throughout. I also really like coffee, my personal favourite is the cappuccino! I would love to chat more, maybe over a cup of coffee?</p>
